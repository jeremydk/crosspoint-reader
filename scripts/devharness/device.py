"""Serial control + observation harness for a connected X3/X4.

Opens the device's USB CDC port once, runs a reader thread that captures every
log line, exposes a small API for sending CMD: messages and waiting on
[STATE] / log signals. Built to drive ENABLE_SERIAL_LOG firmware; release/slim
builds will silently ignore button-inject commands.

Caveat for macOS: opening /dev/cu.usbmodem* with default DTR pulses the C3 USB
peripheral and triggers a chip reset. We force DTR/RTS off before any traffic.
